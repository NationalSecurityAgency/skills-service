Issues page documents any errors or warnings that require a project administrator's attention. Navigate to `Project -> Issues`.

Issues page displays any errors that have been recorded for a Project, how many times they have occurred, and when the most recent occurrence was. There are a number of different issues that are captured here. One example includes attempts to report a Skill that doesn't exist in a Project. This commonly occurs when a typo has been made during the integration of skill reporting into an application, or when switching an application from using a staging project to a production project where the staging skills do not exist or have been created with different Skill IDs.

Skills can be created with their Initial Visibility set to ``Hidden``. When hidden, skills
remain invisible to trainees until the ``Initial Visibility`` is switched to ``Visible``. This feature allows you to
keep skills in draft mode until they are ready for trainee access.

> **TIP**
Once a skill becomes visible, it cannot be hidden again. The `Initial Visibility` control will be removed from the
interface.

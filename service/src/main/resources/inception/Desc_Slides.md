SkillTree enables seamless integration of PDF-based slide decks directly into skills, allowing you to enhance training materials with professionally designed presentations created in tools like PowerPoint and exported as PDFs.

You have two methods to add slide decks:

- **SkillTree Hosted:** Upload PDF files directly using the file upload form (Browse button) or via drag-and-drop
- **Externally Hosted:** Provide a URL to a PDF hosted on an external web server (e.g., https://example.com/slides.pdf)

To set up a slide deck, navigate to `Project -> Subject -> Skill -> Slides` and upload your PDF file.

To upload slides from your computer, click the `Browse` button or drag and drop a file into the upload area. For externally hosted slides, click `Switch to External Link` and enter the file's URL. Don't forget to click `Save and Preview` button to save your changes. A preview will appear in the Preview section once configured.

The built-in slide viewer offers:
- Intuitive navigation between slides
- PDF download capability
- Full-screen presentation mode
- Slide resizing (drag the bottom-right corner)

> **TIP**
> Resize slides by dragging the handle in the bottom-right corner. Click "Save Changes" to apply the new dimensions. Trainees can also adjust slide sizes to their preference. These custom settings are automatically saved in the browser's local storage and will override the default dimensions.

In **full-screen mode**, users can:
- Navigate using `left`/`right` arrow keys
- Access navigation controls by hovering near the bottom
- Exit using the `Escape` key or the exit button in the navigation controls

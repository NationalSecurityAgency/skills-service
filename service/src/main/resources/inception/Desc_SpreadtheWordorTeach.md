It's rewarding to help and educate others (especially when it comes to SkillTree!). But what if you could collect double the rewards? Your wait is over! You can now spread the word about SkillTree while earning SkillTree points.

To earn points for this skill:

1. Present SkillTree to others, show SkillTree to your coworkers or share some information about SkillTree in-person or virtually
2. Click the `I did it` button bellow and in the `Message` field explain how you spread the word about SkillTree.

The request for the points will go to the SkillTree team for approval and they will surely be excited to hear about it!

Skill tagging is a feature that allows administrators to add one or more custom "tags" to skills. Adding tags to skills can help to categorize and group skills, giving users another way search or filter a particular set of skills. Skill tags are visualized in the Skills Display to give users consuming the training another way to comprehend, categorize and filter skills.

To tag skills, navigate to the Skills page (`Project -> Subject`), then select skills to tag and click on the `Action` button located on the top-right above the skills' table. Select the `Tag Skill` button to initiate the process. After a tag has been added, it can be removed by selecting the skills you would like remove the tag from, then click on the `Action` button, and then `Remove Tags`.

> **TIP**
> Once a skill tag is created, you can easily reuse it to tag other skills by selecting it from the `Existing Tag` drop down menu.

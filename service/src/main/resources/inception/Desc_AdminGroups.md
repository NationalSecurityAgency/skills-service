Admin Groups streamline the management of administrators for one or more projects, quizzes, and global badges. Once created, you can easily add and remove members from the group. The group can then be assigned to projects, quizzes, or global badges, granting its members administrative privileges for the assigned items.

- To create an admin group, navigate to the ``Admin Groups`` page and click the ``Admin Group +`` button.
- To assign a group to a project, go to ``Admin Groups -> Projects`` and select a project from the dropdown.
- To assign a group to a quiz, go to ``Admin Groups -> Quizzes`` and select a quiz from the dropdown.
- To assign a group to a global badge, go to ``Admin Groups -> Global Badges`` and select a badge from the dropdown.

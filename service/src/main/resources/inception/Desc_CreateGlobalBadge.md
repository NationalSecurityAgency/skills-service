Global Badges recognize and reward users for achieving skills and levels across multiple projects. These badges help track and celebrate comprehensive skill development that spans different project boundaries. Global Badges can include skills and levels from any project you have Admin access to.

Global Badges are awarded when users meet specific criteria that can include:
- Skills from multiple projects
- Project level achievements
- Any combination of the above

By default, when badges are created, they are in a disabled state. Disabled badges will not show up in the client display, nor can they be achieved by users. This is to allow all dependencies to be added to the badge before a user can trigger achievement. When a badge is published, all users with existing achievements that meet the Badge criteria will be immediately awarded that badge.

> A Badge can only be published one time. Once a Badge has Gone Live, it can no longer be placed into a disabled state


Creating a Global Badge is simple:

### Step 1: Create a New Badge
1. Navigate to `Home -> Global Badges`
2. Click the `Badge +` button
3. **Recommended**: Add a descriptive [Icon](/dashboard/user-guide/icons.html) for better visual recognition

### Step 2: Configure Badge Requirements
After creation, set up the badge criteria:
- **Adding Skills**: `Home -> Global Badges -> Manage -> Skills`
- **Setting Level Requirements**: `Home -> Global Badges -> Manage -> Levels`

> **Note**: New badges start in a Disabled state, allowing you to fully configure all requirements before they become available to users.

### Step 3: Publish the Badge
1. Go to the `Global Badges` view
2. Locate your badge
3. Click the `Go Live` button in the bottom-right corner of the Badge overview

> **Important**: When published, the system automatically awards the badge to all users who already meet the requirements.

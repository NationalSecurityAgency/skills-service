On the Preferences page you can customize you personal dashboard preferences. To navigate to the page

* Click on the `Settings` option
* Navigate to the `Preferences` tab

<strong><em>Preference</em>: Rank and Leader Opt-Out</strong>
Change this setting to true and you will not be shown on the Leaderboard or assigned a rank for all projects. This is a nifty feature to remove project admins from affecting user ranking and appearing on the Leaderboard.

<strong><em>Preference</em>: Default Home Page</strong>
SkillTree Dashboard encapsulates two areas - personal progress and project administrative sections. Customize the landing page for yourself to default to either:

* **Project Admin** \- administrative portion of the dashboard
* **Progress and Rankings** (default) - your personal progress and ranking

If you are responsible for administering a project or two it would make sense to change the default.

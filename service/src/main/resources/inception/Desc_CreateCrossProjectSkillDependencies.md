The Cross-Project Learning Path facilitates cross-application training and enable users to become domain experts across several applications. These dependencies are critical when actions are required to be performed in more than one tool in order to complete a task.

To create a cross-project skill:

1. In `Project A` navigate to `Project -> Learning Path`
2. Scroll down to the `Share skills from this project with other projects` section
3. Select skill to share with other projects, for example, `Skill A` is selected
4. Select which project to share the skill with *OR* share with all projects, click `Share` button
    * for example, `Skill A` is shared with `Project B`
5. In `Project B` navigate to `Project -> Learning Path`, you will see that `Skill A` was shared with this project under `Available skills from other projects for use as prerequisites` section
6. Now in `Project B` `Skill A` can be added as a dependency to any local skills using `Project -> Learning Path`

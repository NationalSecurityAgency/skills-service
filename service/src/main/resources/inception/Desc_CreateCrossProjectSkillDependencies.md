Cross-Project Dependencies facilitate cross-application training and enable users to become domain experts across several applications. These dependencies are critical when actions are required to be performed in more than one tool in order to complete a task.

To create a cross-project skill:

1. In `Project A` navigate to `Project -> Dependencies`
2. Scroll down to the `Can be added as dependencies in other Projects` section
3. Select skill to share with other projects, for example, `Skill A` is selected
4. Select which project to share the skill with *OR* share will all projects, click `Share` button
    * for example, `Skill A` is shared with `Project B`
5. In `Project B` navigate to `Project -> Dependencies`, you will see that `Skill A` was shared with this project under `Can be added as dependencies to your Skills` section
6. Now in `Project B` `Skill A` can be added as a dependency to any local skills using `Project -> Subject -> Skill -> Dependencies`
